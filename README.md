# Not-So-Lone-Wolf-Case-Study
•	A Digital Forensics Case study made by me with the intention of it being used to teach future students of the Digital Forensics Module in the Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics (CSF) course curriculum at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP).
•	Adapted from the 2018 Lone Wolf Scenario by Digital Corpora which can be found at https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/scenarios/2018-lone-wolf-scenario
•	Contained improved evidence files, an updated case scenario, contents of the suspect’s hard drive for creation of Forensic Duplicate, and full documentation of changes/updates made by me.
